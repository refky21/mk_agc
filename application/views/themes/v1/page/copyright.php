                        <strong>Licenses and Legal Issues</strong>
                        <p>
                            downloadlagu123.biz is an information location tool that helps you find and enjoy music legally posted by others on the Internet. We are committed to organizing all the music posted on the Internet for promotional and other legal
                            purposes to serve artists and their fans in the new digital age. We are also committed to respecting the legitimate interests of copyright owners. Therefore, where possible, downloadlagu123.biz negotiates reasonable copyright
                            licenses that also respect the public's legitimate interest in gaining access to public information and preserving the freedom and functionality of the Internet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By enabling our users to find songs posted for promotional and other legal uses, downloadlagu123.biz supports performing artists. We make it easy to discover new music and we make it easy to buy the song, once a listener has heard
                            it. We believe we have created a tool for artists and record labels to promote new music to the new Internet generation.

                        <strong>Information Concerning Copyright Claims</strong>
                        <p>
                            As part of our mission to develop the most complete searchable index of music files legally posted on the Internet for promotional and other legal purposes, our search crawler continuously crawls the Internet for new, legally posted
                            music files. We are, however, primarily an information location tool, and we maintain no editorial oversight over the links in our search index. We do not control the third party websites contained in our index. We are not a "file
                            sharing" site, peer to peer or otherwise; and we in no way support or endorse illegal copying of music. Because we do not own or have editorial control over these third party sites, it is possible that our index may link to some
                            music files that were posted without the copyright owner's authorization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We rely on copyright owners to protect their own copyright interests by communicating with us. We will immediately take down the link in response to a valid notice of alleged infringement submitted under the Digital Millennium
                            Copyright Act ("DMCA"). We urge copyright owners to directly contact any third party website that has posted an infringing music file. The link in the downloadlagu123.biz index only points to the location of the file hosted
                            elsewhere on the web. Accordingly, while downloadlagu123.biz can and does delete the link from its search engine upon request, it does not, because it cannot, delete the infringing file, which was posted and is hosted on the
                            Internet by a third party over which downloadlagu123.biz has no control. We recommend that you use our search engine to identify the third party who posted and is hosting the infringing file, and to contact that third party to
                            delete the infringing music file itself from the Internet prior to having us remove the link.
                        </p>

                        <strong>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</strong>
                        <p>
                            It is our policy to respond immediately to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement. This page describes the information that should be present in these notices. This procedure is designed to make submitting notices of
                            alleged infringement to downloadlagu123.biz as straightforward as possible, while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is
                            consistent with the form required by the United States law (an official summary of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf), but we will respond to notices of this form
                            from other jurisdictions as well. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice. Also, please be aware that there are penalties (including costs and attorney's fees) for false claims under the DMCA. See
                            http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/faq.cgi for more details.
